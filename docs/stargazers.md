## Stargazers

The simplest way to support logsmith is to star the repository on GitHub. Stars make the project more visible to other developers, help us gauge community interest, and motivate maintainers to keep improving the experience.

### Star history

The chart above shows how interest in logsmith grows over time. If you’re evaluating the project for your team, the trend line provides a quick signal of community adoption and momentum.

### Why your star matters

- Increases project discoverability in GitHub search and lists
- Signals to your team that the tool is worth a look
- Encourages contributions and long‑term maintenance
- Helps us prioritize features and documentation improvements

### Easy ways to contribute

You don’t need to write code to make a meaningful impact. Here are a few ideas that take minutes and help thousands of developers who rely on clear release notes:

- Try logsmith on a repository and open an issue if something feels confusing
- Share feedback on the docs: missing steps, unclear explanations, or broken links
- Suggest real‑world examples you’d like to see in the guides
- Add a configuration snippet from your project to the Showcase page
- Improve wording, typos, or accessibility in the docs with a small pull request

### Embed the star chart in your repo

If you use logsmith and want to showcase the activity of your own project, you can embed a star chart badge just like we do here.

```markdown
## Stargazers

[![Stargazers](https://starchart.cc/OWNER/REPO.svg?variant=adaptive)](https://starchart.cc/OWNER/REPO)
```

Replace OWNER and REPO with your GitHub organization and repository names. The badge updates automatically over time.

### Stay involved

- Join our Discord community at <https://discord.gg/stacksjs>
- Follow development on the GitHub project board and issues
- Share your experience on social media and tag the repo
